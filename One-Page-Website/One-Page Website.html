<h4 id="staffy">American Staffordshire Terrier</h4>
<img src="https://vetstreet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94fc9d8/2147483647/thumbnail/645x380/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvetstreet-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc5%2Fe57d80a71811e0a0d50050568d634f%2Ffile%2FAmerican-Staffordshire-Terrier-3-645mk070411.jpg">
<p>That breeding history is why many AmStaffs (as their friends call them) have incredibly trustworthy temperaments with their families. The average AmStaff is playful, gentle and tolerant. Most well-socialized AmStaffs are good with children, but as with any dog, AmStaffs and children should always be supervised when together. Interaction with other animals, especially other dogs, should be closely monitored.
The AmStaff wasn't meant to be a hop-to-it obedience whiz, and he isn't. If you try to force him, he will always win. If you try to make it a game, he will always play, and you will both win. Despite its tough dog persona the AmStaff is a breed that loves to love.</p>
<p>This breed needs a vigorous daily workout, along with some mind games, in order to be at its best. A good long run or a rollicking game of ball is a great way to bond with an American Staffordshire terrier. Obedience training is also good mental exercise.
Its short coat makes it unsuited as an exclusively outdoor dog, and besides, this breed wants to be a part of all family activities. Coat care could not be easier: simply wash and wear.</p>

<h4 id="bully">Bull Terrier</h4>

<p>Bull terriers are gentle, affectionate and playful with family members. They also are loyal pets that will guard the family. As with any large or tough breed, proper precautions around strangers, children, and other animals is essential.
If not given enough exercise and attention from the owners, Bull terriers can be destructive.</p>
<p>Because the breed is powerful and some members may have aggressive tendencies, Bull Terriers must be obedience trained. They must also be carefully socialized from a young age. Socialization requires frequent supervised exposure to other people and pets in the neighborhood. With proper socialization and training, Bull Terriers make great family pets. However, they probably are not a good choice for novice dog owners, nor are they generally recommended for households with other pets or irresponsible children.
Bull terriers must be exercised daily in a fenced-in yard or with walks on leash and should not be permitted to run free, even if trained and socialized. Because of their stocky build, care must be taken not to overfeed as they can easily become obese.</p>
